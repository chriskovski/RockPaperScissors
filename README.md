# Rock, Paper, Scissors

A classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against a Computer.

# Description

This was an exercise following the "The Odin Project"-Path in becoming a web developer.

This is on my first projects where I connected HTML, CSS & Javascript. Therefore it's not very nice looking, but it works.
First I had lots of trouble using the DOM-Manipulation, also there are not many signs of responsiveness in this app. But as soon as I've figured the DOM-Part out, I even added a "Battlelog" feature. I'm really glad I made it work, as I knew only the real basics of Javascript.

# How-To

The rules are unchanged: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock.
So with every "move" (click on your choice), the computer makes a move, too. You can see in the Battlelog what happened (What you chose, what the Computer chose, and who wins the round). First one to win 3 rounds, wins the entire game. There is a Victory (or Defeat) Message in the Battlelog if the game is over.
